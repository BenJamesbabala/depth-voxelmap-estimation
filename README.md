# Single image depth estimation by dilated deep residual convolutional neural network and soft-weight-sum inference

This repo is an implementation of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00534.pdf

I did not write the paper

#TODO: description of the architecture and link the papers that the describe the techniques
