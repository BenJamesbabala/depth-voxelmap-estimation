# Single image depth estimation by dilated deep residual convolutional neural network and soft-weight-sum inference

This repo is an implementation of this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00534.pdf

Explained better here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1708.02287.pdf

Runs: 
 - 2018-03-08--16-41-31 initial with correct implementation, with batch normalization, no weights decay
 - 2018-03-09--17-23-46 hopefully correct learning rate decay, xavier initialization, no weights regularization
